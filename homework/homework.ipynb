    "Beta Pictoris is a young star located approximately 63 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pictor. It has been a target of intense astronomical study since the 1980s, when astronomers discovered a large debris disk surrounding the star. In 2008, astronomers using direct imaging techniques discovered a giant exoplanet orbiting Beta Pictoris, named _Beta Pictoris b_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its discovery, _Beta Pictoris b_ has been observed multiple times using various telescopes and instruments tracking its position relative to the host star. These observations have provided valuable data on the planet's orbit, which is crucial for understanding its formation and evolution, as well as the dynamics of the surrounding debris disk.\n",

    "\n",
    "We recommend watching the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn_Nto4Bd48) for a visual explanation of Keplerian orbits and their parameters but provide a summary below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of Beta Pictoris b around its star follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion. A full three-dimensional orbit is defined by eight orbital parameters that describes its shape and orientation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semi-major axis** ($a$): half of the long axis of the ellipse [AU]<sup>(1)</sup>. The short axis (semi-minor), is related to the semi-major axis and eccentricity by $b = a \\sqrt{1 - e^2}$.\n",
    "- **Eccentricity** ($e$): how elongated the ellipse is (e $\\in [0, 1]$).\n",
    "- **Inclination** ($i$): tilt of the orbital plane w.r.t reference plane which is the plane perpendicular to the line of sight from Earth to the star (in degrees or radians).\n",
    "- **Argument of periapsis** ($\\omega$): the periapsis is the point where the planet is closest to the star. All orbital angles are measured relative to that point. The argument of periapsis defines the angle from the ascending node (the point where the planet crosses the reference plane going \"up\") to the periapsis (in radians).\n",
    "- **Position angle of ascending node** ($\\Omega$): the rotation of the orbital plane around the line of sight (in radians). It orients the orbital plane on the sky.\n",
    "- **Time of periapsis** ($\\tau$): what fraction of the orbital period ago was the last periapsis passage (in fraction of period, between 0 and 1).\n",
    "- **Parallax** ($\\Pi$): the angular shift of the star due to Earth's orbit, which tells us the distance to the star [mas]<sup>(2)</sup>.\n",
    "- **Total mass** ($M_T$): the combined mass of the star and planet (in solar masses [$M_\\odot$]).\n",

    "The angular offsets $\\Delta \\mathrm{RA}$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{Dec}$ at each observation epoch $t$ of the planet relative to the host star on the reference plane can then be computed using Kepler's equations through intermediate angular quantities called anomalies.

    "- Eccentric anomaly ($E$): an auxiliary angle defined implicitly by Kepler’s equation ($M = E - e\\sin E$). $E$ cannot be computed analytically (i.e., no closed form algebraic solution exists), so we will need to solve it numerically (e.g., using the Newton-Raphson method).\n",
